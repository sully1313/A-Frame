#  A-Frame

## What is A-Frame

A-Frame is a open-source framework for creating 3D and virtual reality experiences on the web. It was built by the MozVR team to more quickly prototype WebVR experiences.

Under the hood, A-Frame is built on top of Custom Elements and is powered by three.js. Although A-Frame at first looks like only a handful of custom HTML elements like <a-cube>, A-Frame at its heart is a entity-component-system-based three.js framework with a DOM interface. Everything in an A-Frame scene is an entity which we plug components into in order to compose appearance, behavior, and functionality. This allows experienced developers share reusable components that other developers can drop into their scene and use immediately. The scene above looks needlessly verbose, but we see its true power when weâ€™re able to attach and compose appearance and behavior at whim.
